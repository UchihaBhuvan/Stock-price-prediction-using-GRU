# Stock-price-prediction-using-GRU

Predicting stock prices is a complex task with significant implications for investors and financial analysts. Traditional methods often fall short due to the inherent volatility and non-linearity of financial markets. Recent advances in machine learning, particularly the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have shown promising results in capturing the temporal dynamics of stock prices.

This project explores the application of Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), a specific type of RNN, to predict stock prices. GRUs are known for their efficiency and ability to learn long-term dependencies in data, making them well-suited for time series forecasting tasks like stock price prediction.
